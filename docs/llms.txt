# Daymon

> Open source autopilot for Claude. Scheduled tasks, persistent memory, background automation.

Daymon is a macOS menu bar app that gives Claude persistent memory, scheduled tasks, workers, and file watchers — all running locally on your machine. No API keys. No cloud. Uses your existing Claude subscription.

## How It Works

Install Daymon → it auto-configures Claude Desktop and Claude Code → tell Claude what you want scheduled, remembered, or watched → Daymon handles the rest in the background.

## Features

- **Scheduled Tasks**: Cron, one-time, or on-demand. "Every weekday at 9am, check HackerNews for AI news." 24 built-in schedule presets.
- **Persistent Memory**: Knowledge graph with semantic search. Say it once, it sticks forever. Hybrid FTS + vector search.
- **Workers**: Named agent personalities with system prompts. 9 templates (Chief of Staff, Researcher, Code Reviewer, Writer, Email Assistant, Tech Trend Analyst, Competitor Tracker, DevOps, Data Analyst) or create your own.
- **Auto-Nudge**: When a background task finishes, results automatically appear in your active Claude Code chat. Per-task control: always, failures only, or never. Quiet hours support.
- **Self-Improving Tasks**: Tasks get smarter every run. Memory-aware execution injects past results and cross-task knowledge.
- **Session Continuity**: Tasks resume where they left off using `--resume`. Each run builds on the last.
- **File Watchers**: Watch folders for changes and act automatically.
- **100% Local**: SQLite database on your Mac. No cloud, no account.

## Architecture

- **Electron** menu bar + Dock app (thin UI shell)
- **Sidecar** standalone Node.js HTTP server (cron scheduler, file watchers, task execution, embeddings)
- **MCP Server** (stdio transport) for Claude Desktop and Claude Code integration
- **Shared modules** used by both sidecar and MCP server
