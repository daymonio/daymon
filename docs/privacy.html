        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="lead">Daymon is a local-first, open-source desktop application. Your data stays on your machine. This policy explains what information exists, where it is stored, what the website collects, and your rights regarding that information.</p>
        <p class="legal-effective">Effective date: February 16, 2026</p>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>1. Overview</h2>
          <p>Daymon ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Daymon desktop application and the website at daymon.io. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information in connection with our software and website. By using Daymon or visiting daymon.io, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>Daymon is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Anthropic, PBC.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

          <h3>2.1 Information You Create in the Application</h3>
          <p>When you use Daymon, you may create tasks, memories, workers, file watchers, and other content. All of this data is stored exclusively in a local SQLite database on your computer. Daymon does not transmit this data to any Daymon-operated server because no such server exists.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tasks and run history</strong> &mdash; task prompts, execution results, and logs are stored locally.</li>
            <li><strong>Memories</strong> &mdash; entities, observations, and embeddings you create are stored locally.</li>
            <li><strong>Workers</strong> &mdash; worker names, roles, and system prompts are stored locally.</li>
            <li><strong>Settings</strong> &mdash; your preferences (quiet hours, notification settings, etc.) are stored locally.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically by the Application</h3>
          <p>Daymon offers an optional, opt-in setting to share anonymous crash reports and diagnostics. This setting is <strong>disabled by default</strong>. When enabled, the following anonymous data may be transmitted:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Application version and operating system version</li>
            <li>Anonymized machine identifier (a hash &mdash; not your device serial number or MAC address)</li>
            <li>Aggregate usage counts (e.g., number of tasks created, not their content)</li>
            <li>Crash stack traces (code paths only &mdash; no user data, task content, or memory content is ever included)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>No personal information, task content, prompts, memory data, or file contents are ever transmitted. You can disable this at any time in Settings.</p>

          <h3>2.3 Information Collected by the Website</h3>
          <p>The website at daymon.io collects information through the following third-party services:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics</strong> &mdash; collects anonymous usage data such as page views, referral sources, browser type, and approximate geographic location. Google Analytics uses cookies. You can opt out by installing the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Ads conversion tracking</strong> &mdash; measures download button clicks on the homepage to evaluate advertising effectiveness. This may set a cookie.</li>
            <li><strong>X (Twitter) conversion tracking</strong> &mdash; measures website visits and download button clicks for advertising analytics. This uses the X Universal Website Tag and may set cookies. See <a href="https://x.com/en/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X's privacy policy</a> for details.</li>
            <li><strong>GitHub API</strong> &mdash; the website makes a client-side request to the GitHub API to display the repository star count. This request is subject to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub's privacy statement</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>Daymon connects to the following third-party services during normal operation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Claude CLI (by Anthropic)</strong> &mdash; when a task runs, the prompt and any context are sent to Anthropic's API through the Claude CLI. This communication is governed by <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthropic's privacy policy</a> and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terms of service</a>. Daymon does not control, intercept, log, or store the data transmitted between the Claude CLI and Anthropic's servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Hugging Face Transformers</strong> &mdash; local vector embeddings are computed entirely on your machine using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model. No data is sent to Hugging Face servers. The model is downloaded once and cached locally.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Daymon does not sell, rent, share, or otherwise transfer your data to any third party, except as described above in the normal operation of the software.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
          <p><strong>The Daymon application</strong> does not use cookies.</p>
          <p><strong>The Daymon website</strong> may set cookies through the following services:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Google Analytics (anonymous usage analytics)</li>
            <li>Google Ads (conversion tracking)</li>
            <li>X / Twitter (conversion tracking)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These are third-party cookies managed by their respective providers. You can control or disable cookies through your browser settings. Disabling cookies will not affect the functionality of the Daymon application.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Application data</strong> &mdash; tasks, memories, workers, and run history are stored on your machine indefinitely until you choose to delete them. You can delete individual items through the application or remove all data by deleting the SQLite database file.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash reports</strong> (if opted in) &mdash; retained for 90 days, then automatically deleted.</li>
            <li><strong>Website analytics</strong> &mdash; retention periods are governed by Google's, X's, and GitHub's respective data retention policies.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
          <p>Daymon is designed with a local-first security model:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>All data is stored in a local SQLite database with no network exposure. The database is not accessible remotely.</li>
            <li>The application does not open any network ports or run any server that accepts external connections.</li>
            <li>The database uses WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode for data integrity and crash resilience.</li>
            <li>Communication with Claude CLI uses Anthropic's encrypted transport. Daymon does not implement its own authentication because there is no remote access to authenticate.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While we take reasonable measures to protect the integrity of your local data, no software can guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for securing access to your computer and the files stored on it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
          <p>Because Daymon stores all data locally on your machine, you have full and immediate control over your data at all times:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Access</strong> &mdash; your data is a SQLite file you can open, query, and inspect at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion</strong> &mdash; delete individual items through the application, or remove all data by deleting the database file at <code>~/Library/Application Support/daymon/</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability</strong> &mdash; export your data by copying the SQLite file. It is a standard, open database format.</li>
            <li><strong>Correction</strong> &mdash; edit any data directly through the application interface or MCP tools.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Daymon does not sell your personal information. Daymon does not engage in profiling, automated decision-making, or targeted advertising based on your application data. If you are located in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, or California, the rights afforded to you under GDPR, UK GDPR, or the CCPA/CPRA are inherently satisfied by the local-first architecture &mdash; your data never leaves your machine.</p>
          <p>For website analytics data collected by third-party services (Google, X), please refer to their respective privacy policies and opt-out mechanisms to exercise your rights.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>8. Do Not Track</h2>
          <p>Some browsers transmit a "Do Not Track" (DNT) signal. The Daymon application does not track you in any way, regardless of this signal. The Daymon website uses third-party analytics services that may not honor DNT signals. We recommend using browser extensions or privacy settings to control tracking on the web.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Application data</strong> &mdash; no international transfers occur. All data remains on your local machine.</li>
            <li><strong>Claude API calls</strong> &mdash; when tasks execute, prompts are sent to Anthropic's servers, which may be located in the United States. This is governed by <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthropic's privacy policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Website analytics</strong> &mdash; data collected by Google Analytics and X conversion tracking may be processed in the United States or other jurisdictions per their respective policies.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>Daymon is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will update the effective date at the top of this page. Since Daymon is open source, all changes to this policy are visible in the <a href="https://github.com/daymonio/daymon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public repository's commit history</a>. Your continued use of Daymon after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
